                I am a privateer motorcycle road racer from Cornwall, Ontario. 2011 marked my third
                year as an amateur racer in the R.A.C.E (Racing Associates Canada Events) series.
                I started my first season in 2008 on my vintage GS550 – the season was basically
                spent getting to know my bike and the different tracks. Season two, 2009 saw me
                steadily improve on the GS and graduate to an SV650. I went on to win a 3rd place
                podium finish my first race on the SV – no less in the rain. Season three, in 2010
                marked my first complete season on the SV. I started out with fairly aggressive
                goals and was able to accomplish even more than I thought possible. I look forward
                to what I can achieve in 2011, with the help of my pit crew and sponsors.
